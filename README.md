# Extracting Data from the Internet in Python

This workshop will cover how to extract data from the web using Python. We'll be covering both APIs and webscraping.

### Topics Covered

- How the web works
- Accessing databases via RESTful APIs
- HTML / CSS 
- Manipulating a webpage with Google DevTools
- Webscraping with Beautiful Soup
- Scraping javascript-heavy sites and interactive sites with Selenium

### Requirements

This workshop will be using the Python programming language. See the software requirements [here](B_Tech-Requirements.md).

We will assume a basic knowledge of Python. If you've taken the D-Lab's Python Intensive, that should be sufficient. 

**Please note that materials are still in development, and will be changing.**
